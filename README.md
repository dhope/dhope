### ðŸ‘‹ Welcome.

My name is David and I am a quantative biologist working for the [Canadian Wildlife Service](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/avoiding-harm-migratory-birds/canadian-wildlife-service-contact-information.html) of Envirnoment and Climate Change Canada. My focus is Ontario, particularly the north and work in Ottawa.

My background is in [behavioural ecology of migrating shorebirds](https://www.sfu.ca/biology/wildberg/NewCWEPage/takingthepulse/index.html). Now I focus on survey design and analysis of breeding songbird data. I'm particularly involved in the [Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas](https://www.birdsontario.org/) these days. The code I post here is my own creation and my employer definetly takes no responsibility for the mistakes and bugs within.
